CAESER_SHIFT encoder / decoder

This repository contains a couple simple python programs that I wrote as I learn python.

Dependencies:  python3

To use:  download main.py and art.py and save them in the same location.  Run the script as python3 main.py.

Program will ask if you are encoding or decoding a message, what the message is, and what the shift is.

enjoy.

PS:  main2.py includes numbers and symbols, but something is still wonky with it.
